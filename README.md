# Predict-Password-Strength-using-Natural-Language-Processing
This project aims to assess and predict the strength of passwords using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By analyzing password characteristics such as length, character variety, and patterns, the model can classify passwords as "weak," "medium," or "strong." This type of prediction can be useful in creating secure systems by providing feedback to users on their password strength.
# Dataset
This project requires a dataset containing passwords labeled by their strength level (e.g., weak, medium, strong). Commonly used datasets for password strength prediction are available on Kaggle and other open-source repositories.
# Requirements : 
Python
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, keras, tensorflow


# Usage
- Data Preprocessing: 
Preprocess the data by running the preprocessing cells in the NLP_password_asma.ipynb notebook. This includes tasks like tokenizing, character analysis, and feature extraction.
- Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from each password using NLP techniques.
- Model Training: Train your model by following the steps in the notebook. You can try different algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks, to improve accuracy.
- Prediction: Use the trained model to predict password strength on new data.
Run the notebook NLP_password_asma.ipynb for step-by-step guidance on the entire process.
